Number Slider, a Number Puzzle Game.

I made it for fun. My hometown was locked down 'cause of COVID 19 (from April to June, 2020). I don't have anything to do and cannot going outdoor.

This app writen in Html5, CSS  and javaScript. The player can chooses size of board ( 3 x 3, 4 x 4 or 5 x 5). 
In this app, I use 25 pictures as tile numbers. the player click on a tile for sliding between clicked tile and blank tile.

Source code files in folder NumberSliderHTML_Ex are another version of this app. This version doesn't need any number pictures.
It draws the number itself during playing game. 
Notice: no sound supports in this version.

Hope you have funny time!
